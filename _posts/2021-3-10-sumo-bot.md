Remote control 3d printed robots over a livestream.

Virtual Sumo Bot Competition <br/><img src='/images/sumobotlogo.png' style='width:400px;'>
======

This club project was started as a means to reach out to the community and inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists to find an interest in robotics. My goal was to incorporate interests kids K-8 had into robotics my idea was to create a videogame where the kids are able to through a video livestream, virtually control robots and compete in a king of the hill style event. 

Work on the clubs side involved 3D modeling and printing the robots, wiring the electronics, and coding the website to work well. All this took us approximately 1.5 months from start to the first working match.

Below to the left you can see the first example robot I made for the rest of the team to base their robots on along with certain criteria. To the left is the final robot we used for the competition. It was easy to print, reliable, and offered space for easy and quick electronics work to be done. Here is a link to a [model](https://a360.co/3x9uB2V) of it!

To save space on our sumobot as well as teach club members how to solder prototype cirtuits, we decided to solder an ESP8266, line sensors, as well as easily accessible ports in a layout shown on this diagram.

The result led to two versions of the circuit shown below. The left resulted in being too fragile resulting in 6 of the left circuits to replace them. They were smaller and not a single one has broken in the dozens of times we have dropped them.
