This fall I transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from the College of Dupage majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Chemistry. To me, transferring here means a new start and being at UIUC means new opportunities and goals are to be accomplished.

I have many interests but my passions lie in organic chemistry and robotics. Small molecules have great potential to bridge robotic sensing and locomotion on small scales and I know my prior experience running an interdisciplinary robotics team at the College of Dupage provides me with a solid foundation of knowledge I am eager to expand on. Soft robotics made of silicon and 3D-printed actuators to allow for flexure were just a few projects I introduced to the team to bring enthusiasm into this domain. I am excited to find new opportunities at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am currently looking for a part-time research position for this fall and spring where I can further my passions in robotics and organic chemistry as well as finding an internship for the summer to expand my working knowledge and hopefully kickstart my career.
