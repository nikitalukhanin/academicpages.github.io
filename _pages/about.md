I am currently a sophomore mechanical engineering student with a minor in chemistry at the College of Dupage. In the fall of 2021, I am transferring to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to pursue their dual degree program in chemistry and mechanical engineering.

My passion outside of class lies in robotics where at CoD I am the current robotics team captain. I work on leading development of a rover for a NASA hosted competition as well as various outreach events where we allow students and kids of all backgrounds to learn about robotics through virtually controlling robots through live websteams while learning about their inner workings.

I am currently looking for an internship this summer where I can further my interests in robotics as well as chemistry. I prove I show hard work and determination through my team and side projects and don't plan on stopping any time soon.
